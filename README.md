## How It Works

**Authentication:** JWT tokens issued on login, verified on protected routes. Passwords hashed with bcrypt.

**Roles:** Three tiers (user, host, admin) with role-based route guards and permission checks.

**Image Uploads:** Properties store up to 5 images on Cloudinary, managed by multer middleware.

**Cron Jobs:** Automated tasks run in the background:
- Expiring pending bookings after a set time  
- Marking completed bookings when checkout date passes

**Availability & Dates:** Hosts can block date ranges. System checks availability when creating bookings.

**Ratings:** After checkout, guests can review properties (1–5 stars). Average rating updates automatically.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Payment gateway integration (Stripe/Razorpay)
- [ ] Email notifications for bookings and reviews
- [ ] Google Maps integration for property locations
- [ ] Real-time messaging between guests and hosts
- [ ] SMS notifications
- [ ] Advanced analytics for hosts
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
